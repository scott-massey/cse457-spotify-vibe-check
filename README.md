You can access the process book by clicking on the process book icon in the menu of the website. Code for the book exists at `src/Components/ProcessBook.js`.

All of our code sits inside of `src`, with all of the visualization code sitting inside `src/Components/Dashboard`.

A tutorial modal displays when you open the website, which explains how to use all of the features of the website. You can also access the tutorial by clicking on the ? icon in the menu of the website.
